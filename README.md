## Application Tasks for course Programming-101-Python-2020-Spring

### 1.Sensors
You have a company that measures bad air levels in Sofia. You have sensors all over the city. Sometimes the sensors break or  
start to give incorrect results. For this reason, you have placed more than 1 sensor in most places.You can find out if a sensor  
is defective if there is a very large difference between its value and the values of the sensors that are "adjacent" to it. In a  
language of your choice, write a program that reads from a file and removes all possible faulty sensors. The file name, the maximum distance that defines close sensors, and the maximum allowable error between sensors are obtained from standard input.

### 2.Correct Brackets
We define "Correct brackets" as follows:  

Correct brackets are:  
a) () - left bracket (to the right bracket)  
b) (< correct brackets >) - left bracket (to correct brackets, to right bracket)  
c) < correct brackets > < correct brackets > - correct brackets to correct brackets  
  
In the language of your choice, write a program that reads from the standard input a submitted string and returns whether that string is "Correct Brackets".
  
### 3.Rotting Apples
You know that if an apple is rotten, in 3 days all the apples around it will be rotten.  
In a language of your choice, write a program that reads from the standard input:  

- box size - N x M (NOTE: Boxes do not have a zero row or column.)
- the coordinates of the rotten apples
- in how many days you will return to your house  

Find out what the tape looks like after this period.  
O - fresh apple  
X - rotten apple
